Sample from dataset:

- Question: What are the different types of diabetes?
- Answer: Diabetes is classified into several types, including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and specific types due to other causes. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of beta cell function and insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy, and specific types can result from genetic conditions, pancreatic disorders, or medication use.
